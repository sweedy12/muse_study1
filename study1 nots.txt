Shira (condition 2):
1. Stressfull. 
2. understood instructions, but had to focus hard. The last 
3. The reminder table does not fit the shown problem, can be confusing.
4. Instinctively, the first column is just the name, and the second is the elaboration (however for us the first is the elaboration and second is inspiration)
5. didn't feel too short or long.
6. effort - 
7. did not feel creative
8. The problem of "protecting plants" was too vague. 
9. Did not understand the connection between the purpose and the mechanisms. 

Amir (condition 1)
1. What about going back in the instructions?
2. 


Ariel (condition 3)
1. Confused by the "protect plants"  - is everything about protecting plants or not? (should be fine in the study)
2. A lot of text to read (condition 3)
3. Should we filter out (or ask) familiarity with the problem?
4. what makes an innovative idea?  - perhaps emphasize what is an innovative idea, and not the opposite
5. should we have the sub-bullets. 
6. inspiration text a bit small 
7. personalized suggestions?
